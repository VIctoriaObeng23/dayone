<h2 style="color: blue;">ABOUT US</h2>
<p>Books offer a wide breadth of information, experience, and knowledge. But unlike many electronic media, books also offer a great depth of information, experience, and knowledge. Books inform us about other people, other countries, other customs and cultures.
itles of books should be underlined or put in italics. (Titles of stories, essays and poems are in "quotation marks.") Refer to the text specifically as a novel, story, essay, memoir, or poem, depending on what it is. In subsequent references to the author, use his or her last name.
If you read regularly, you'll always find yourself hungry for something more out of life. More knowledge, more information, more stories, more experience, more books. Reading makes you curious to know it all. You'll never get bored.</p>
